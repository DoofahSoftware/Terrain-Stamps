# Terrain-Stamps

This is a collection of various Textures and Brushes for the Unity Terrain Stamp Tool.

## About the Textures

The Textures for the Stamps were generated procedurally using World Creator 2. 

World Creator 2 is a very powerful real-time terrain generator. You can check it out here, if you are interested:

It took only minutes to create these terrains with this professional application. So I thought I'd share for free :-)

A few example screenshots whot the stamps look like:

## Additional Information

Please note that as to the writing of this page the Stamp Tool of Unity doesn't support resize and rotation via Mouse. I created a version of the Stamp Tool which supports those features. You can get it from here:

Let's hope Unity will support this in a future release out of the box.

## Credits & Greetings

Credits and greetings to the developers of World Creator 2 and the awesome community on the World Creator discord. Without their hard work this wouldn't have been possible so easily. And the help and support you get from the community is remarkable.
